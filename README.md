How does Amazon know I was interested in a bed sheet I had already in my Walmart.com cart?
Why do I keep getting similar ads across platforms? This practice is called personalized 
advertising, where online ads promote the products and services their customers will be most
interested in, to make profit. Instagram, for instance, is a social media platform that
implements this personalized advertising algorithm to persuade their users to remain for a
prolonged period of time on the site and guarantee a sale. This is conducted by collecting
data on user interaction, such as searched keywords, number of likes on a post, comments, and
number of shares.



The objective of this project is to understand & replicate the Instagram Personalized 
Advertisement algorithm within a Python environment by implementing a K-Means clustering based 
on user likings and interests.
